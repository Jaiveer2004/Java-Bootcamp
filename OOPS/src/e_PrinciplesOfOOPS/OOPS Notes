# OOP Principles in Java
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods). Java is a fully object-oriented language, and its design revolves around four core OOP principles. These principles help in writing modular, reusable, and maintainable code:

1. Encapsulation:
* Bundling data (fields) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class), while restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
* Achieved using access modifiers (private, public, etc.) and getter/setter methods.

2. Inheritance:
* Allows one class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from another class (superclass), promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship.

3. Polymorphism:
* Enables a single interface or method to represent different types or behaviors. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
* Achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).

4. Abstraction:
* Hides complex implementation details and exposes only the essential features of an object. It simplifies interaction with objects by providing a clear interface.
* Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.


# Inheritance in Java
* Inheritance is a mechanism in Java where one class (called the subclass or derived class) inherits the fields and methods of another class (called the superclass or base class).
* It enables code reusability and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes (e.g., a "Dog" is-a "Animal").

Syntax:
Inheritance is implemented using the "extend" keyword.
class Superclass {
    // Fields and methods
}

class Subclass extends Superclass {
    // Additional fields and methods
}

Here, Subclass becomes a child class of Superclass.
Parent : Superclass
Child : Subclass

Example of Inheritance:
class Animal {
    String name;

    Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    void eat() {
        System.out.println(name + " is eating.");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog(String name) {
        super(name); // Call superclass constructor
    }

    void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " is barking.");
    }
}

public class InheritanceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog("Buddy");
        dog.eat();  // Inherited from Animal
        dog.bark(); // Defined in Dog
    }
}
Explanation:
1. Animal is a Parent Class.
2. Class Dog extends from parent class Animal and "Dog" becomes child class of parent class "Animal"
3. All the methods of the Animal class would be available for the Dog class.
4. In the main function, we have called "eat" method of the Dog class which it has inherited from the Animal Class, It would give output : Dog is eating


# Important Concepts in Inheritance:
1. "super" keyword:
* It is a reference variable that is used to refer to the immediate parent class (superclass) of a subclass.
* It mainly has three uses:
    - Calling the Superclass Constructor
    - Accessing Superclass Methods
    - Accessing Superclass Fields

- Calling the Superclass Constructor
Example:

class Animal {
    String name;

    Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        System.out.println("Animal constructor called");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog(String name) {
        super(name); // Calls Animal's constructor
        System.out.println("Dog constructor called");
    }
}

public class SuperConstructorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog("Buddy");
        System.out.println("Dog's name: " + dog.name);
    }
}

Explanation: When super is used in the child class, it invokes the constructor of the parent class.
NOTE : If parent class doesn't consist of a constructor which takes no parameters, a compilation error will occur.

- Accessing Superclass Methods
Example:
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Some generic animal sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        super.sound(); // Calls superclass method
        System.out.println("Woof");
    }
}

public class SuperMethodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.sound();
    }
}
Explanation: Here, when super keyword is used in the child class, it calls the method of the parent Class.
So, super is also used to call the method of the parent class.

By same way, we can also use variables of the parent class in the child class using the super keyword.
In the Box class, suppose we have a same name variable as in BoxWeight : weight
Now, if we want to access Superclass weight from the subclass, we can use the super keyword

We have two classes : Box and BoxWeight

Box:
public class Box {
    double l;
    double b;
    double h;

    Box() {

    }

    // Cube
    Box(double side) {
        this.l = side;
        this.b = side;
        this.h = side;
    }

    // Rectangle
    Box(double l, double b, double h) {
        this.l = l;
        this.b = b;
        this.h = h;
    }

    // Copy Constructor
    Box(Box old) {
        this.l = old.l;
        this.b = old.b;
        this.h = old.h;
    }

    public void showInfo() {
        System.out.println("This is a message for showing info.");
    }
}

BoxWeight:
public class BoxWeight extends Box{
    double weight;

    public BoxWeight() {
        this.weight = -1;
    }

    public BoxWeight(double l, double b, double h, double w) {
        super(l, b, h); // Used to call the constructor of the parent class.
        // But it can't access the member variables that are private in parent class.

        this.weight = w;
    }
}

Here, are two classes:
1. Box : A superclass that represents a box with dimensions (l for length, b for breadth, h for height).
2. BoxWeight : A subclass that extends Box and adds a weight field.

Now, if we define a new object in the Main function as:
Box b2 = new BoxWeight(25.0, 25.0, 25.0, 25.0);

Step by step Explanation and flow of code:
1. The new keyword creates an object of the "BoxWeight" class. (This is created in Heap Memory)
2. A reference variable b2 of type "Box" is created. (This is created in Stack Memory)
3. The ref variable b2 points towards "BoxWeight" object.
4. When object is being created, the constructor of BoxWeight gets initialized and values are stored.
5. Inside this constructor:
   super(l, b, h): This calls the superclass (Box) constructor Box(double l, double b, double h) with arguments 25.0, 25.0, 25.0.
   In the Box class, this constructor initializes:
   this.l = 25.0
   this.b = 25.0
   this.h = 25.0
   this.weight = w: After the superclass constructor finishes, the weight field of BoxWeight is set to 25.0.
6. Result: A BoxWeight object is created with:
   l = 25.0 (inherited from Box)
   b = 25.0 (inherited from Box)
   h = 25.0 (inherited from Box)
   weight = 25.0 (specific to BoxWeight)

In Java, a superclass reference can point to an object of its subclass due to polymorphism. This is called an "is-a" relationship: a BoxWeight "is-a" Box.
So, b2 is a reference of type Box, but it points to an object of type BoxWeight.


Now, what does this newly created object of BoxWeight see which is referred by the Box b2.
As (l, b, h) are member variables of the Superclass. So, it can only see these variables.
While (w) which is a member variable of the Child Class, can't be seen by the object created.

So, if we try to access :

System.out.println(b2.w);
This would result in an error.

Which principles are applied on this example:
1. Inheritance:
    BoxWeight extends Box, inheriting its fields (l, b, h) and methods (showInfo()).
    The super(l, b, h) call in BoxWeight’s constructor ensures the Box portion of the object is properly initialized.

2. Polymorphism:
    The reference Box b2 can hold a BoxWeight object because BoxWeight is a subclass of Box.
    This allows flexibility: you can write code that works with Box types and still handle BoxWeight objects (or other subclasses) without modification.

3. Encapsulation (Implied):
    While the fields l, b, h, and weight are currently public (default package access), in a real-world scenario, they’d typically be private with getters/setters to enforce encapsulation. The super keyword respects this by only accessing what’s available through the superclass’s public/protected interface.

Now, consider this example:
BoxWeight b2 = new Box(25.0, 25.0, 25.0);

This would result in an error, as Box doesn't know about the (w) as it is member variable of the subclass.

What does super refer to:

We have structure of classes like this:

        Grandparent class ----> Parent Class ---> Child Class ---> Grandchild Class

When super is used in Parent Class : It refers to the Grandparent Class
When super is used in Child Class : It refers to the Parent Class
When super is used in Grandchild Class : It refers to the Child Class

What if super is called in a class which is not inherited from any class?
* According to internal implementation of class, all the classes have "Object" class as a superclass of it.
* Every class has {@code Object} as a superclass. All objects, including arrays, implement the methods of this class.

Now, lets get to type of inheritance:

1. Single Inheritance:
    - One class extends another class
    - Example: Box extends BoxWeight

2. Multilevel Inheritance:
    - Multiple levels of Inheritance.
    - Structure: Grandparent class ----> Parent Class ---> Child Class ---> Grandchild Class
    - Example: Box extends BoxWeight, BoxWeight extends BoxPrice

3. Multiple Inheritance:
    - Multiple classes are extending more than one class.
    - Structure:
                    Male Class    -----
                                      | ----- Child Class
                    Female Class  -----
    - Example:
    A extends C
    B extends C

    Question : If A has a variable n = 10 and B has a variable n = 15. We make a new object of C and try to access the variable n. Which value would show up?
    Answer : This is a problem in Java, because of which Multiple Inheritance does not exists in JAVA.

Multiple Inheritance is not supported by JAVA.
If we want to access multiple parent classes, we can use "Interfaces" in Java.

4. Hierarchical Inheritance :
    - One class is inherited by many classes.
    - Structure : X extends A, X extends B, X extends C

5. Hybrid Inheritance :
    - Combination of Single and Multiple Inheritance.
    - Structure : A extends B, A extends C; B extends D, C extends D (making a loop)
    - Since, Multiple Inheritance does not exists in Java. So, it also does not exist.
    - Interface is used for the same


# Polymorphism: Poly -> Many, morphism: ways to represent : Many ways to represent a single entity or object

In Java, polymorphism is closely tied to inheritance and is achieved in two primary ways:

1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism): Resolved at compile time (e.g., method overloading).
2. Run-Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism): Resolved at runtime (e.g., method overriding).
